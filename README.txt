How does it work:
    - It basically changes the 'new tab' page, it dynamically changes the wallpaper, according to the time of the day/night

Requirements:
    - It actually has one requirement, the extension called 'New Tab Redirect', that allows the user to customize the url for the 'New Tab' page
    - source: 'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna'

    * IT COULD BE ANY OTHER EXTENSION THAT DOES THE SAME THING *

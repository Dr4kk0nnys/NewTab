How does it work:
    - It basically changes the 'new tab' page, it dynamically changes the wallpaper, according to the time of the day/night

Requirements:
    - It actually has one requirement, the extension called 'New Tab Redirect', that allows the user to customize the url for the 'New Tab' page
    - source: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna

    * IT COULD BE ANY OTHER EXTENSION THAT DOES THE SAME THING *

How to use:
    - Once the 'New Tab Redirect' extension was installed
    - Open the extension options ( chrome-extension://icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna/options.html )
    - paste the path of the index.html file to the extension on the 'Redirect URL' field
    - path should be something like:
        'file:///home/User/Documents/NewTab'
        * I'm on linux *
